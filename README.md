# Intro

Brownian motion in one variable constitutes the simplest random fractal, and also it is at the heart of all the following generalizations. Small particles of solid
matter suspended in a liquid can be seen under a microscope to move about in an irregular and erratic way. This was observed by the botanist R. Brown around 1827.
The modeling of this movement is one of the great topics of statistical mechanics. Occasionally Brownian motion is also referred to as "brown noise". In one dimension
we obtain a random process $X(t)$ , i.e. a function $X$ of a real variable $t$ (time) whose values are random variables $X(t_l)$, $X(t_2)$, etc.
