# Description

This repository contains the browning fractal movement in one and two dimensions represented by The spectral synthesis method (also known as the Fourier filtering method) for generating fBm.

Brownian motion in one variable constitutes the simplest random fractal, and also it is at the heart of all the following generalizations. Small particles of solid matter suspended in a liquid can be seen under a microscope to move about in an irregular and erratic way. This was observed by the botanist R. Brown around 1827. The modeling of this movement is one of the great topics of statistical mechanics. Occasionally Brownian motion is also referred to as "brown noise". In one dimension we obtain a random process $X(t)$ , i.e. a function $X$ of a real variable $t$ (time) whose values are random variables $X(t_l)$, $X(t_2)$, etc.
